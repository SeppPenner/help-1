<h1>Error message while signing in on a website.</h1>
<p><span class="modalTitle">You want to log on to a Website but receive an error message (ERR_ZERO_SIZE_OBJECT). The reason for this can be the "HTTP Referrer Header", which you have removed in the eBlocker menu under "Blocker" &gt; "Advanced Settings" tab. Many websites need the HTTP referrer header information to identify you when you log in. Disable the "Remove HTTP Referrer Header" function and log on to the website again.</span></p>
