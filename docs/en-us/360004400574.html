<h1>What is the Tor Network?</h1>
<p>The Tor network is used to disguise your original IP address and to provide anonymous Internet surfing. Suppose you have a certain page you want to visit and therefore you enter the URL into the web browser. Your IP address is sent directly to the page you want to visit. However, if you use Tor, you will be directed into the Tor network, which is made out of many other IP addresses from different computers. The Tor network will send an IP address to the page that it chooses randomly out of all the other IP addresses floating around the Tor network. This is how your real IP address is disguised.</p>
