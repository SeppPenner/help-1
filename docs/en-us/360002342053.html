<h1>The VPN connection is slow.</h1>
<p>If you establish a VPN connection through the eBlocker, it may be slower than a connection through the app of your VPN provider, or the third-party app. This is because the eBlocker performs many other features besides this VPN connection and if necessary, has to also process the network traffic of several devices. Whereby the app has to only process the network traffic of a device. In addition, the strength of encrypting a VPN connection can also affect the speed of your connection.</p>
