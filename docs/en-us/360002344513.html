<p>Usually the process works very well with common websites. There might only occur some connection problems when using certain apps that are connected directly to the server. Currently, we know over 100 apps that are already in an exception list and can be enabled easily so that the apps can function as usual. Technical savvy users can also define an app exception. Or you can let us know and we will take care of it. <br>Generally speaking; if a website or an app requires a lot of tracking and therefore problems with the eBlocker occur, you can always click on “Pause” and have the eBlocker paused for that device. Afterwards everything works as if the eBlocker is not switched on. Pause lasts 5 minutes and might be extended on the eBlocker dashboard.</p>
