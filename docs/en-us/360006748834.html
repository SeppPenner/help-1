<h1>I have a new router, what do I have to do?</h1>
<p>Before installing the new router, please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>For your old router, activate the DHCP server in the settings menu.</li>
<li>For eBlocker (Settings &gt; Network) set the network mode to "automatic".</li>
</ul>
<p>After saving these changes, your eBlocker restarts - this takes about five minutes.</p>
<p>Now you can exchange the old router for the new one. Then restart all devices (including the eBlocker) once or disconnect briefly from the network connection.</p>
<p><strong>A hint from Support:</strong></p>
<p>It is likely that your new router has different DHCP server settings than your old router. Therefore, delete all devices found in the eBlocker settings from the Devices menu and restart the search.</p>
