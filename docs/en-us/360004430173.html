<h1>How does the eBlocker block trackers from creating user profiles?</h1>
<p>We are using community-maintained, open-source filter lists to determine whether an HTTP request is sent to a known tracking server. In this case eBlocker blocks the request and does not send any data to the tracker. In addition we have developed adaptive self-optimizing algorithms and are constantly maintaining custom filters to ensure maximum privacy protection for you.</p>
