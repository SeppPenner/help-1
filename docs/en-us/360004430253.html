<h1>Does the eBlocker support HTTPS/SSL encrypted connections?</h1>
<p>Yes, the eBlocker supports HTTPS/SSL connections for web browsing if the user enables the HTTPS function. The eBlocker forms the end of the encrypted end-to-end connection with the server, analyzes the packets and encrypts them again when accessing the internet device. In order for this encryption to work, the so called root encryption certificate – individually for each eBlocker – must be recorded once in the browser or in the operating system.</p>
<p>This process is an “industry standard” to protect encrypted connections and is also successfully used by us.</p>
