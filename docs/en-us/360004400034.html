<h1>Why does the eBlocker also block online advertising?</h1>
<p>Most online ads (banner, video, text etc.) are already tracking and profiling you just by loading the ad even if you don’t click on it. Therefore by default eBlocker blocks data collecting online advertising. Of course, you have the ability to turn on the advertising for Web pages of your choice – but you will be tracked again on these pages.</p>
