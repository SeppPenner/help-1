<h1>Running with errors / Database stopped </h1>
<p>You see the error message "eblocker is running with errors" or "database stopped" when starting your eBlocker, or when calling the eBlocker user interface?</p>
<p>In this very rare case, please try to restore the eBlockers factory settings to solve this problem.<br>Instructions for restoring the factory settings can be found <a href="360004553934.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>If your eBlocker still shows this error message, please create a small status report with the help of an USB 2.0 flash drive. Please send this file with a short description of your problem to our support team (support@eblocker.com).</p>
<p>How to write a short status report on a USB thumb (USB2.0 / FAT16 or FAT32 formated) drive?</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect eBlocker from power, but let the Ethernet cable connected to the eBlocker</li>
<li>Insert a USB thumb drive (On the eBlocker in the transparent case, please use one of the USB ports on the longer side, not the ports next to the Ethernet port)</li>
<li>Power up the eBlocker</li>
<li>Wait for 3 minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>After that you can pull out the USB drive and attach it to your computer. There should be a file "eblocker-status.html" on the drive. Please send this file to our support (support@eblocker.com).</p>
