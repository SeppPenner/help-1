<h1>Where can I find block lists on the Internet?</h1>
<p>There are many block lists available in the Internet, but most of them are hard to find. The following two websites offer a collection of block lists.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://firebog.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://firebog.net/</a> you will find mainly <strong>domain</strong> and<strong> ect.hosts</strong> lists. Always pay attention to the beginning of the lists. If you find an IP address at the beginning (127.0.0.1 or for example 0.0.0.0), it is an ect.hosts list.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://filterlists.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://filterlists.com/</a> you can find a lot of filter lists. Here you can for example search for "<strong>AdBlock</strong>" lists, which you can import into the eBlocker Pattern Blocker. Make sure that you select the "<strong>easylist</strong>" format for such lists.</p>
