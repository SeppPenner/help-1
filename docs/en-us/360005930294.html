<h1>The cloaking doesn't work. </h1>
<p>Cloaking is an eBlocker Pro and Family function.</p>
<p>You have activated the cloaking and visited our test <a href="https://www.eblocker.com/en/privacy-check/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>. You are apparently not cloaked and can see your location, your operating system and your browser?</p>
<p>The cloaking can only work on all websites when the eBlocker HTTPS (SSL) function has been activated and the eBlocker certificate has been stored on all devices. Only then the cloaking can work on encrypted (HTTPS) websites.</p>
