<h1>Does the eBlocker replace a firewall?</h1>
<p>The eBlocker protects your intimacy while browsing. It prevents third parties from collecting data about you without your consent. A firewall protects your home network from external access. The eBlocker also includes a firewall, but it only protects the eBlocker itself from attacks. To protect your home network, we recommend using your own firewall.</p>
