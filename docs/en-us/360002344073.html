<h1>Neither router nor eBlocker as DHCP server</h1>
<p>There is also the option to use neither the DHCP server from the router nor the DHCP server from your eBlocker. You can also integrate another DHCP server in your network. For example, some NAS devices offer an additional DHCP server function. For another option you can also build your own DHCP server based on a single-board computer.</p>
