<h1>WiFi access points and the eBlocker</h1>
<p>A WiFi access point is used to improve signal strength and range in homes and small offices. Devices that log on via the WiFi access point are forwarded from the WiFi access point to the router. The WiFi access point usually ensures that the combination of IP address and MAC address per device is retained, so that the eBlocker can identify and protect all devices individually.</p>
