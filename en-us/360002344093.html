<h1>eBlocker DHCP server and fixed IP addresses</h1>
<p>If you activate the eBlocker DHCP server, the eBlocker takes over all found IP addresses from your network. All IP addresses will be marked as fixed IP addresses in the DHCP server of your eBlocker. Via the menu "Devices" you can then specify whether a device should keep its fixed IP addresses.</p>
