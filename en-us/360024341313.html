<h1>Does the eBlocker continue to work (even without updates)?</h1>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The eBlocker will continue to work without updates, but the full scope of protection may not be available after some time, as new/changed trackers and malware are potentially no longer detected. A final update is planned for June, so that eBlocker customers can use public, or free list sources for filters.</p>
